Congratulations to your purchase of our schwenking party planning server!
You are now the proud owner of the best available schwenking party planning tool in existence.
Never again will you have to worry about your guests not bringing what they committed to bring!
They can simply use their clients to store their culinary commitments on your server.
When the party starts, you can easily check whether they brought what they promised to bring.
Our patented advice: If somebody tries to cheat, make them fetch additional booze for the party!

In order to comply with the recent data non-protection rules (DNPR) which some of the politicians try to introduce,
we opted to store commitments in an encrypted form, instead of using one-way functions.
Then we are able to hand over the keys to law enforcement agencies in case of serious criminal offenses.
If, for example, somebody brings spoiled meat or too few beers to the party, we can bring the offender to justice!

Please note, that the client is currently unavailable.
We have strong reason to believe, that the former supplier of the client - the Crypto AG - has compromised the integrity of the cryptographic parameter generation.
We are currently collaborating with renowned researchers from CISPA in order to develop a new client - one which adheres to our high saarl√§ndisch quality standards.
There are still some customers who use the old client.
If you notice that somebody tries to store weakly encrypted commitments, feel free upgrade them to higher standards.
